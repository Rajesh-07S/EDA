 Heart Attack Analysis  
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## 📍 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a heart attack dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships among medical attributes that influence heart disease risk.

Using **statistical analysis** and **data visualization**, the project aims to extract meaningful insights that can support early risk detection and healthcare decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset  
- Identify important medical features related to heart attacks  
- Analyze correlations between health parameters  
- Visualize trends and patterns using plots  
- Gain insights useful for early risk identification  

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains medical information of patients with the following attributes:

| Feature | Description |
|------|------------|
| Age | Age of the patient |
| Sex | Gender of the patient |
| Chest Pain Type | Type of chest pain |
| Resting Blood Pressure | Blood pressure at rest |
| Cholesterol | Serum cholesterol level |
| Fasting Blood Sugar | Blood sugar after fasting |
| Resting ECG | Electrocardiographic results |
| Max Heart Rate | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| Exercise-Induced Angina | Angina due to exercise |
| ST Depression | ST depression induced by exercise |
| Target | Presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease |

## 📈 Visualizations
The following visualizations were used in the analysis:
- Bar charts  
- Histograms  
- Box plots  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Count plots  
- Scatter plots  

These visualizations help in understanding data distribution, outliers, and feature relationships.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Features such as **age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate** show strong relationships with heart attack risk  
- **Males** have a higher occurrence of heart disease compared to females  
- **Exercise-induced angina** and **ST depression** are strong indicators of heart disease  
- Correlation heatmaps highlight significant dependencies between features  

---

## 🚀 Conclusion
This Exploratory Data Analysis provides a clear understanding of the factors influencing heart attacks.  
The insights gained from this project can be used as a foundation for **predictive modeling and machine learning applications** in healthcare.

---

## 📌 Future Work
- Build machine learning models for heart attack prediction  
- Perform feature selection and model evaluation
